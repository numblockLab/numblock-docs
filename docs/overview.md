Welcome to the NumBlock documentation. This document has been created with the aim to provide developers, validators, and researchers with an overview of the NumBlock ecosystem. It covers NumBlock as a concept, explains the NumBlock tech stack, and documents advanced topics for more complex applications and use cases.

Additionally, to ensure easy accessibility, we have divided the documentation into sections that cater to different components within the ecosystem.
