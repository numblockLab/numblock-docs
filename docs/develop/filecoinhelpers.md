Filecoin is built on top of IPFS and supports storing data long-term via on-chain deals. Together, they help us break free from centralized services while conveniently allowing us to enjoy the same luxuries of speed and guaranteed storage that centralized services would bring.

## Storage Helpers (IPFS + Filecoin)

- [Estuary](https://estuary.tech): Pinning service that stores and retrieves data on both IPFS and Filecoin networks via simple API calls ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHAMHbpioGw))

- [Lighthouse.storage](https://lighthouse.storage/): Permanent storage on IPFS and Filecoin that allows users to pay once and store forever. Lighthouse can also be used to store private data and build token gated applications on Filecoin.

- [NFT.storage](https://nft.storage): NFT storage service that stores and retrieves data relating to NFTs on IPFS and Filecoin ([video](https://youtu.be/Ckb4RRJo-W0))

- [Web3.storage](https://web3.storage): Data storage service that stores and retrieves data on IPFS and Filecoin ([video](https://youtu.be/lPEqg6oL3Nk))

- [Textile Powergate](https://docs.textile.io/powergate/): Highly configurable wrapper for IPFS+Filecoin inside a Docker container, with bridges Polygon, and other smart contract networks

- [Fleek Space Daemon and Space SDK](https://fleek.co/space-sdk/): For decentralized browser, mobile, or desktop development
