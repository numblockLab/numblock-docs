We started with the idea of making software that is *modular*.This is something that is present in almost all parts of the NumBlock blockchain. NumBlock architecture offers several advantages over traditional, monolithic blockchain designs. Here are some of the key benefits of NumBlock architecture:
- Scalability: One of the main advantages of NumBlock is its scalability. With a modular design, it is easier to add or remove modules to adjust to changes in the network's size and complexity. This allows for better scaling of the blockchain system, which can handle more transactions and users as the network grows. Through the pre-built cross-chain bridge, NumBlock blockchain is capable of infinite scalability, and blockchains can connect and communicate with each other.
- Flexibility: NumBlock also offers greater flexibility, allowing developers to customize the system to meet specific requirements. By breaking the blockchain down into smaller modules, developers can choose the most suitable modules for their use case, rather than being restricted to a fixed set of modules.
- Maintenance: NumBlock also makes maintenance and upgrades easier. Each module can be updated and maintained separately, without affecting the rest of the system. This reduces downtime and minimizes the risk of errors that can occur when making changes to a monolithic blockchain system.
- Security: NumBlock also enhances the security of the system. By separating the various functions of the blockchain into self-contained modules, the risk of a security breach affecting the entire system is reduced. This also makes it easier to isolate and contain any security breaches that do occur.
- Interoperability: Finally, NumBlock enhances interoperability. By defining well-defined interfaces between modules, different blockchain systems can communicate and interact with each other seamlessly. This allows for greater collaboration between different blockchain networks, increasing the overall utility and value of the blockchain technology.

NumBlock employ a multi-faceted approach that leverages a combination of complementary scaling solutions to achieve maximum scalability. These solutions include layer-2 scaling techniques, parallelization, and, eventually, ZK technology.

By integrating these methods, NumBlock can efficiently accommodate the increasing demand for processing power, data storage, and transaction throughput as the number of users and applications on the network grows.

In summary, NumBlock is designed to optimally address the issues that other blockchains face, including scalability, security, and decentralization.
