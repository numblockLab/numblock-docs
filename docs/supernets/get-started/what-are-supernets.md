## Introduction

Supernets are application-specific chains that operate on the Polygons Edge consensus client with [PolyBFT consensus](/docs/supernets/design/consensus/polybft/overview.md). They leverage a [native bridge](/docs/supernets/design/bridge/overview.md) to connect with an associated rootchain, namely, Polygon PoS mainnet, enabling them to inherit its security and capabilities. Additionally, Supernets extend the block space available on the rootchain, providing scalability and interoperability for decentralized applications. With on-chain governance mechanisms, Supernets empower communities to make decisions and upgrade the network in a transparent and compliant manner.

:::info Edge + Supernets = Geth + Ethereum

Before diving into the documentation, please keep the following points in mind:

- **The Polygon Supernets product suite was officially introduced in v0.7.x of the Polygon Edge client.**
- **The Polygon team will prioritize the latest version of the Edge client and as a result, will no longer provide support for older versions (v0.6.2 and earlier).**

  The Edge repository will remain accessible, and users may fork it and use it as they wish, subject to applicable open-source license terms. It is **highly recommended to upgrade to the latest version**, which includes the most up-to-date features and fixes. However, users who prefer to stay on older versions may continue to do so.

- **Polygon Edge serves as a consensus client implementation for Polygon Supernets, much like how Geth serves as a client implementation for Ethereum.** Both Geth and Edge serve as intermediaries between nodes and their respective blockchains, allowing users to interact with the network and take advantage of its benefits. To draw an analogy, Geth and Edge are to Ethereum and Supernets what web browsers are to the internet, enabling users to access and interact with the network.

The following table offers a comprehensive overview on what Supernets are through different perspectives.

| Supernets are | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Application-specific blockchain networks designed for specific use cases. | Appchains are customizable blockchain networks that developers can tailor to meet specific enterprise or application use cases. With appchains, developers can create high-performance blockchain networks that are fast and low-cost. |
| The next phase of Polygon PoS and Ethereum scaling. | Supernets empower projects and enterprises to create highly scalable layer 3 blockchain networks that meet their specific block space requirements while inheriting the security and integrity of the Polygon PoS and Ethereum mainnet. |
| Modular and complex-minimized blockchain development. | Supernets offer a modular framework that simplifies blockchain development, providing developers with the tools necessary to create customizable blockchain networks that are scalable, secure, and interoperable. Developers can use the Supernets stack to create high-performance blockchain networks with advanced capabilities without worrying about complex integrations or intermediaries. |
| Customizable blockchain networks for reliable business logic. | A customizable virtual machine provides full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) support out of the box, enabling developers to tailor the virtual machine to their specific needs and requirements. This feature includes customizing gas limits, adding new opcodes, and integrating with other technologies. |
| The most supported blockchain infrastructure in the web3 space. | The Supernets ecosystem includes the most extensive suite of premium service providers, who offer various node and deployment infrastructure, indexers, explorers, oracles, and many other world-class tools necessary for building and deploying Supernets and their associated applications. |
| Adaptive and compliant blockchain networks that thoroughly reflect their maintainers. | Supernets feature an on-chain governance mechanism that enables community-driven decision making and management of the blockchain. This mechanism supports hybrid governance models and allows for the design of either permissionless networks or permissioned networks with varying degrees of sovereignty based on user and maintainer needs, including the ability to allowlist validators and network admins. |
| Interoperable and multichain driven | A native bridging solution enables the seamless transfer of assets from various EVM-compatible blockchains back to the Polygon ecosystem. This bridging solution allows developers to customize bridge plugins to meet specific requirements, facilitating interoperability between blockchains and different layers. |

## Unstoppable Layer 2 & Layer 3 Networks

Supernets are pioneering unstoppable networks for the internet, where decentralized and secure applications can thrive.

</div>

The diagram above demonstrates how Supernets are interconnected with the Polygon PoS network, which benefits from the security properties of Ethereum. By leveraging blockchain technology, Supernets provide a strong foundation for building decentralized and blockchain-based solutions that can withstand adversarial conditions, resist censorship, and scale to meet the increasing demand for processing power, data storage, and transaction throughput.

Supernets employ a multi-faceted approach that leverages a combination of complementary scaling solutions to achieve maximum scalability. These solutions include layer-2 scaling techniques, parallelization, and, eventually, ZK technology.
