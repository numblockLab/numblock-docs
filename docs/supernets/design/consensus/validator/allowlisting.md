This document provides an overview of how validator allowlisting works in Supernets.

Allowlisting is a critical feature in Supernets that restricts participation in consensus rounds to a select group of validators. The contract owner manages a list of authorized validator addresses that can participate in consensus rounds. The allowlisting mechanism is a powerful tool for building permissioned networks and solutions.

The Supernet allows the owner to add or remove validator addresses from the allowlist. This mechanism can also be used to restrict access to other functions or features of the contract. For example, the contract owner may restrict access to administrative functions or sensitive data to only authorized addresses.

By restricting access to certain functions or features, it becomes easier to ensure that only authorized parties can interact with the network in a way that complies with regulatory requirements. For example, a compliant-based network may restrict access to certain functions or features to only authorized entities such as licensed financial institutions.

In addition to restricting participation in consensus rounds, allowlisting can prevent malicious actors from taking control of the network. Restricting access to certain functions or features makes it much more difficult for attackers to compromise the network's security.
