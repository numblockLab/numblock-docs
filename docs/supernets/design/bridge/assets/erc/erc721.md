This document presents an overview on the ERC-721 standard available in Supernets.

ERC-721 is a token standard that allows for the creation of unique, non-fungible tokens on a blockchain network. In the context of Supernets, ERC-721 tokens can be used to represent unique assets on the network's Supernet.

## ChildERC721

Developers can use the [`ChildERC721`](/docs/supernets/interfaces/erc721/childerc721.md) token standard to create ERC-721 tokens on the Supernet. To create a new ChildERC721 token, developers can use the ChildERC721 predicate contract as a template and deploy it on the Supernet. The contract requires a name and symbol to determine the unique identity of the token.

Once created, `ChildERC721` tokens can be minted and burned on the Supernet through the corresponding `ERC721Predicate` contract. This ensures that the supply of tokens on the rootchain and the Supernet remains in sync. The `ERC721Predicate` contract also allows for the transfer of tokens between the two networks using the native bridge.

## Predicates

The [`RootERC721Predicate`](/docs/supernets/interfaces/erc721/rooterc721-predicate.md)  contract serves as the rootchain token predicate contract, while the [`ChildERC721Predicate`](/docs/supernets/interfaces/erc721/childerc721-predicate.md) contract serves as the Supernet token predicate contract. When a user wants to deposit an ERC-721 token on the rootchain into the Supernet, they call the `deposit` function on the `RootERC721Predicate` contract with the appropriate parameters, including the token ID, sender, and receiver addresses.

When a user deposits a token for the first time, the token mapping between the root and Supernet is created automatically. This mapping allows users to deposit and withdraw tokens between the root and Supernet.

## Deposits and Withdrawals

The `ChildERC721Predicate` contract includes functions for minting and burning child tokens, which are triggered when the deposit and withdrawal functions are called. To withdraw a child token back to the rootchain, a user calls the appropriate function on the `ChildERC721Predicate` contract with the necessary parameters, including the token ID and receiver address. The `ChildERC721Predicate` contract then burns the child token and emits a withdrawal event. The `RootERC721Predicate` contract listens for these events and relays them to the rootchain using the `L2StateSender` contract.
