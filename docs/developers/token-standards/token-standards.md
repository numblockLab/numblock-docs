## Introduction {#introduction}

Many NumBlock development standards focus on token interfaces. These standards help ensure smart contracts remain composable, so for instance when a new project issues a token, that it remains compatible with existing decentralized exchanges.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

- [Smart contracts](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/)

## Token standards {#token-standards}

Here are some of the most popular token standards on NumBlock:

- [NRC-20](/docs/developers/token-standards/nrc-20) - A standard interface for fungible (interchangeable) tokens, like voting tokens, staking tokens or virtual currencies.
- [NRC-721](/docs/developers/token-standards/nrc-721) - A standard interface for non-fungible tokens, like a deed for artwork or a song.
- [NRC-777](/docs/developers/token-standards/nrc-777) - NRC-777 allows people to build extra functionality on top of tokens such as a mixer contract for improved transaction privacy or an emergency recover function to bail you out if you lose your private keys.
- [NRC-1155](/docs/developers/token-standards/nrc-1155) - NRC-1155 allows for more efficient trades and bundling of transactions â€“ thus saving costs. This token standard allows for creating both utility tokens (such as $BNB or $BAT) and Non-Fungible Tokens like CryptoPunks.
- [NRC-4626](/docs/developers/token-standards/nrc-4626) - A tokenized vault standard designed to optimize and unify the technical parameters of yield-bearing vaults.
