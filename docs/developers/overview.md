# Overview

In this section, we introduce developers to libraries and tools to easily develop dapps on NumBlock. NumBlock is an EVM-compatible blockchain, so developers can easily access NumBlock.

Here are some reasons why developers should choose NumBlock:

* Fast transaction times (3100 tps on a single chain), infinite expansion & low transaction fees.
* A [stable token for transactions](/docs/foundational-topics/intro-to-token) & gas fees.
* Smart Contract, DApp & toolset compatibility with other Ethereum-based chains like Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, BSC and others.
* Full-featured explorer [BlockScout](https://testnet.numblock.org/).
* Growing ecosystem designed to support stable person-to-person transactions, micro transactions, conference currencies, community currencies, DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, ticketing systems, betting, games and more.
