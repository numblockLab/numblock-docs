NumBlock is a long-term blockchain project with multiple phases. In 2022, we focused on developing modules and the platform architecture for the project. In Q1 2023, we will focus on launching the NumBlock testnet. Additionally, we will also launch demo applications for creating NFTs, tokens, and smart contracts on NumBlock. The goal is to launch the NumBlock mainnet by the end of 2023.
