Unfortunately, larger block sizes result in centralization of the network as the hardware requirements of running full nodes increases in response to the need for higher computational output. Monolithic blockchains, in particular, run into this issue as an increase in throughput is correlated with an increase in the cost to verify the chain, resulting in less decentralization.
