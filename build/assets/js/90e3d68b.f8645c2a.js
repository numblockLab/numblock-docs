And why should I have one?##\nUnderstanding hardware wallets means getting 'under the hood' of Ethereum a little bit. Let's first take a look at what we mean when we talk about a 'wallet'. At first glance, it's an intuitive concept: it's a digital container to hold digital money and other things. Just like, in a real wallet, you may have some currency and some pictures of your cat or your family; well, in your MetaMask wallet you have some currency and some CryptoKitties and an animated GIF of a zombie. Pretty similar so far."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Well, it turns out that calling it a 'wallet' is a bit of a metaphor. It's a good one in terms of how we experience it, but it doesn't accurately represent what's happening, technologically. The contents of your 'wallet' actually consists of the assets assigned to your address on the blockchain. When we send ETH 'to' someone, it doesn't go anywhere; it's simply deducted from the balance of ETH assigned to your address, and reassigned to the balance of the address you're sending it to. Remember, a public blockchain is also called distributed ledger technology, and all of our wallets are lines in that ledger; our balances, our holdings, are the columns, and the Ethereum Virtual Machine is our automated bookkeeper."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"In this sense, MetaMask is 'simply' a web application that sends requests to the Ethereum blockchain: for information about what assets are assigned to your address; to 'send' tokens from one address to another, and so on.
