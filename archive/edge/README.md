# [ARCHIVED] Polygon Edge documentation

We would like to inform you that the Polygon Edge documentation (for version 0.6.2 and earlier) has been archived and will no longer be maintained. Please note that the new Polygon Supernets documentation will only document the latest version of the Edge client, starting from version 0.7.x where the beta version of Supernets was first introduced.

The Polygon Labs developer team has been hard at work gathering and incorporating community feedback into Polygon Supernets, and we highly recommend that you refer to the new documentation to ensure you have access to the most up-to-date information and features.

Please note that the repository for older versions of the Polygon Edge (version 0.6.2 and earlier) will continue to exist, and users will have the ability to fork and do as they please, subject to applicable open-source license terms.
