## Polygon Community Forum Guidelines

At Polygon, we are committed to creating a decentralized, open-source,
and accessible-for-all web3 space and this starts with an open community
filled with positivity, active engagement, open discussion of ideas, and
mutual respect.

### Community Culture

The Polygon Community Forum, and the broader community that uses the platform,
are dedicated to developing, improving, and further decentralizing the Polygon
ecosystem. Our community culture is one of openness, inclusiveness,
and positivity.

### Core Values

The rules and guidelines of the forum reflect the core values of the Polygon
ecosystem.

### Ecosystem First

We always prioritize the health of the ecosystem and community above particular
interests. Any intentional disruption or act that endangers the well-being of the
Polygon community will not be tolerated.

### Openness

The forum is open, accessible, and transparent by its nature. Feel free to share
your thoughts and ideas on anything and everything related to Polygon.

### Growth

We are here to build and advance Polygon's scaling solutions, but we are also here
to build ourselves and each other. Ultimately, if you find yourself wondering, "should
I post this?" Ask yourself whether it aligns with the values and
guidelines below.

### Guidelines

Much like the blockchain itself, the Polygon community does not discriminate against
participants based on their color, sexual orientation, gender, nationality, or
background. Therefore, we will not tolerate any derogatory comments whatsoever,
including those regarding users' race, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or
age.

This is not an exhaustive list, and you should keep in mind the following guidelines
when posting anything on the forum.

### When on the Polygon Community Forum, you should:

1. Be tolerant towards others' viewpoints. When you disagree, do it respectfully.
2. Communicate with courtesy and respect.
3. Provide accurate information. If you need more clarification, always crosscheck the
   facts before posting.
4. Treat people online as you would treat them in real life.

### You should not:

1. Make personal attacks on others.
2. Make false statements against others.
3. Bully or make inflammatory remarks towards other community members.
4. Use inappropriate language.
5. Post profanity or prejudiced comments.
6. Post sexually explicit content.
7. Post spam.

**Failing to adhere to the above-mentioned rules may result in a permanent ban.**

### What should I do when I want to report such behavior?

1. Click on the flag icon below the offending post.
2. Select a category and click the "Flag Post" button.
